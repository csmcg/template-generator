# template-generator

template-generator is a graphical tool for generating document outlines that adhere to the Informal and Formal report templates of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Electrical and Computer Engineering Department's specifications.

t-g generates both LaTeX source files (.tex) as well as Rich Text Format (.rtf) files for use with WYSIWYG editors, such as LibreOffice Writer and Microsoft Word.

t-g utilizes [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/), and as such requires it as a dependency. GNU sed is not packaged with t-g. To use t-g, install GNU sed and make sure the binary is in your executable path.
