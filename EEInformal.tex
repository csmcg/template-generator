% Informal EE Report
%
% Memorandum style reports are usually used for small projects and industrial
% communications. These reports are usually shorter and less rigid in format
% than formal reports. However, they do contain background, results, and
% discussion even if not formally labeled as such.
%
% Informal written reports should contain: 1) transmittal documentation, 2) a
% one to two-page summary, 3) all pertinent tables and figures that explain and
% present the results and conclusions, and 4) any detailed calculations.
%
% Transmittal Documentation
%
% In the style of a memorandum, the informal report should begin with the name
% of the person to whom the report is being submitted, the name of the person
% submitting the report, the date of submission, and a meaningful subject line
% describing the content of the report.
